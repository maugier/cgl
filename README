cgl, the CLI GeoLocator

cgl is a command-line tool to get geolocation information.

It will try to retrieve BSSIDs from nearby wifi access points, by running wpa_cli,
or fallback to iwconfig to get the current cell BSSID. The BSSIDs are then submitted
to Google's geolocation service, and the resulting position returned in YAML format.
